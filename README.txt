This is Bython2!

Bython is basically Python but with Braces.
Bython was made by mathialo.

And now I have returned with a better version.
It has macros, custom syntax definition. How much
more better can you get?

I am stil refining the syntax highlighting for sublime.
But I will release it soon.

Hello world example:
```
# This is just boiler plate.
#macro: ("__entry__", "main")

def main(argc, argv) {
	print("Hello, world!");
	return 0;
}
# It can also be written as just
print("Hello, world!"); # although argv isnt available unless sys is imported.
```
